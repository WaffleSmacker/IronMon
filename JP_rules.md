# The IronMON Challenge

The IronMon challenge is a [Pokémon Randomizer](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases)
Challenge run created by [Iateyourpie](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie). Designed to make experiencing the randomizer
fun and challenging, while taking away the wild Pokémon grind that come with some other challenges. It was originally
made for Fire Red / Leaf Green but the rules can be applied/adjusted for other games as well. If you're interested to
find out more about IronMon, join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/jFPYsZAhjX)!

IronMon has varying levels of difficulties, to keep it more approachable but also provide the toughest challenge
possible for those who want it.

See the full list of legendary pokemon [here](https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/legendary.shtml). Pseudo-legendaries like Salamence are allowed.                                                                                        | If your randomly selected starter is a banned pokemon, you must instead select another starter.

| Accidental Kills/Catches      | <li>If you accidentally kill a Pokémon while trying to catch it, you will no longer be able to capture or kill a Pokémon from that Route.</li><li>If you catch a pokemon (accidental or otherwise) that you don't mean to add to your team you can immediately deposit it in the PC without viewing any information about its stats or moves. And then continue as if it never happened.</li> | You may throw pokéballs at a pokemon for reasons like being unable to run or if you are trying to scout its moves without risking killing it.                          |
| No Redos                      | You may not re-fight trainers at any point using the VS Seeker or other means.

| Shiny Clause                  | If you encounter a shiny, you are allowed to kill it for EXP as a bonus kill in addition to your allotted 1 catch/kill for that route.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | You may not increase the shiny pokemon rate using the randomizer                                                                                                       |
| Don't Give Up Without a Fight | You may not reset before the first battle if you don't like the starter Pokémon. After that it's fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | You might be surprised how far you can go with what looks like a terrible starter                                                                                      |
| Don't be Rude                 | You have to talk to MOM when you start your journey, otherwise that's just rude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Kaizo IronMon Ruleset

These additional rules are meant to be insanely stupid and hard. These are not meant to be fair, and possibly not even
fun. But if you are truly someone who wants an impossible challenge, this is for you. These rules are also
non-negotiable. If you wish to adjust rules just play Standard Ironmon and Ultimate as your ruleset.

## Survival IronMon Ruleset

The goal of this ruleset is to be even more difficult than Kaizo, while also putting a twist on how one approaches their
strategy with IronMON. Now you are restricted in how many Centers you can use, so you’ll need to be wiser with your
resources both in moves + health. The early game is buffed with potion purchases, which should increase the odds of you
getting past the first gym or two, while tapering off late game. This run should be full of small meaningful decisions.

## FAQs

> Q: Is this a ROM Hack?  
> A: No! At it's core it is just the base Pokémon run through a randomizer.

> Q: Where can I Find the randomizer  
> A: https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases

> Q: Is there a way to configure the Randomizer settings easily?  
> A: Join the IronMon [Discord community](https://discord.gg/jFPYsZAhjX) for an up-to-date settings string to load the settings easily and help with any questions.

> Q: I've seen a bunch of streamers with their stats tracked on screen and the ability to quickly reset to a new seed, how do I get that?  
> A: Several community members have made some tools to make the ironMon experience better. Check out the #resources channel in the discord for the trackers, and other great tools!

> Q: What if I accidentally break a rule? Do I have to end my run?  
> A: Ultimately these challenges are made to have fun! Mistakes happen, a little mistake doesn't need to instantly disqualify the run. Just keep to the spirit of the challenge and if you got an advantage in breaking a rule, try to give yourself an equal punishment.

> Q: Who can I ~~complain to~~ thank for creating this challenge?  
> A: Find Iateyourpie on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/iateyourpie), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Iateyourp1e), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAwIbbB6OE1OAd-gisAl5jA).
